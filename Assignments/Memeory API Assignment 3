Memeory API Assignment 3

Q 1) First, write a simple program called null.c that creates a pointer to an integer, sets it to NULL, and then tries to dereference it. 
   Compile this into an executable called null. What happens when you run this program?
A 1) It gives segmentation fault

Q 2) Next, compile this program with symbol information included (with the -g flag). Doing so let’s put more information into the executable, enabling the debugger to access more useful information about variable names and the like. 
     Run the program under the debugger by typing gdb null and then, once gdb is running, typing run. What does gdb show you?
A 2) First compile using gcc null.c -o null -g.
     Then run gdb null, once the GNU Debugger starts running type run - 
     Starting program: /usr/local/educative/a.out 
     warning: Error disabling address space randomization: Operation not permitted

    Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
    0x00000000004004e6 in main () at null.c:4
    4           *ptr = 8;

Q 3) Finally, use the valgrind tool on this program. We’ll use the memcheck tool that is a part of valgrind to analyze what happens.
     Run this by typing in the following: valgrind --leak-check=yes null. What happens when you run this? Can you interpret the output from the tool?

     The *ptr has not been assigned to the stack. means the *prt at address 0x0 doesnt belong to this program.

Q 4) Write a simple program that allocates memory using malloc() but forgets to free it before exiting.
     What happens when this program runs? Can you use gdb to find any problems with it? How about valgrind (again with the --leak-check=yes flag)?
A 4) It runs fine. 
     No.

Q 5)  Write a program that creates an array of integers called data of size 100 using malloc; then, set data[100] to zero.
      What happens when you run this program? What happens when you run this program using valgrind? Is the program correct?
A 5) Nothing happens. Output seems correct.

Q 6) Create a program that allocates an array of integers(as above), frees them, and then tries to print the value of one of the elements of the array.
     Does the program run? What happens when you use valgrind on it?
A 6) It runs with no error.
