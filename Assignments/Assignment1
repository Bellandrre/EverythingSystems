Operating Systems Schedulers HW - 1

Q 1) Run process-run.py with the following flags: -l 5:100,5:100. What should the CPU utilization be (e.g., the percent of time the CPU is in use?) Why do you know this? Use the -c and -p flags to see if you were right.
A 1) The trace for the program is as follows - 
Time     PID: 0     PID: 1        CPU        IOs 
  1     RUN:cpu      READY          1            
  2     RUN:cpu      READY          1            
  3     RUN:cpu      READY          1            
  4     RUN:cpu      READY          1            
  5     RUN:cpu      READY          1            
  6        DONE    RUN:cpu          1            
  7        DONE    RUN:cpu          1            
  8        DONE    RUN:cpu          1            
  9        DONE    RUN:cpu          1            
 10        DONE    RUN:cpu          1

Since both the process use 100(max) units of the CPU, when a process with PID 0 runs, the process with PID 1 is in ready state not using the CPU. Once the PID 0 completes, PID 1 gets to use the CPU all by itself.



Q 2) Now run with these flags: ./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0. These flags specify one process with 4 instructions (all to use the CPU), and one that simply issues an I/O and waits for it to be done. How long does it take to complete both processes? Use -c and -p to find out if you were right.
A 2) The trace for the program is as follows -
Time     PID: 0     PID: 1        CPU        IOs 
  1     RUN:cpu      READY          1            
  2     RUN:cpu      READY          1            
  3     RUN:cpu      READY          1            
  4     RUN:cpu      READY          1            
  5        DONE     RUN:io          1            
  6        DONE    WAITING                     1 
  7        DONE    WAITING                     1 
  8        DONE    WAITING                     1 
  9        DONE    WAITING                     1

Since PID 0 takes 100 units of CPU, PID 1 waits until PID 0 completes. PID 1 starts when PID 0 finishes.
A better solution for this type of scheduling would be to send the PID 1 to do I/O at time slice 1 and switch to PID 0 after doing that. This way when PID 1 is busy doing I/O, PID 0 can execute using the CPU and we can get better performance.



Q 3)Switch the order of the processes: -l 1:0,4:100. What happens now? Does switching the order matter? Why? (As always, use -c and -p to see if you were right)
A 3) The trace for the program is as follows - 
Time     PID: 0     PID: 1        CPU        IOs 
  1      RUN:io      READY          1            
  2     WAITING    RUN:cpu          1          1 
  3     WAITING    RUN:cpu          1          1 
  4     WAITING    RUN:cpu          1          1 
  5     WAITING    RUN:cpu          1          1 
  6*       DONE       DONE                       

Stats: Total Time 6
Stats: CPU Busy 5 (83.33%)
Stats: IO Busy  4 (66.67%)

If PID 0 in this case (1:0) is scheduled first, then we see better performance as explained in A 2.



Q 4)Weâ€™ll now explore some of the other flags. One important flag is -S, which determines how the system reacts when a process issues an I/O. With the flag set to SWITCH_ON_END, the system will NOT switch to another process while one is doing I/O, instead of waiting until the process is completely finished. What happens when you run the following two processes (-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END), one doing I/O and the other doing CPU work?
A 4) The trace for the program is as follows - 
Time     PID: 0     PID: 1        CPU        IOs 
  1      RUN:io      READY          1            
  2     WAITING      READY                     1 
  3     WAITING      READY                     1 
  4     WAITING      READY                     1 
  5     WAITING      READY                     1 
  6*       DONE    RUN:cpu          1            
  7        DONE    RUN:cpu          1            
  8        DONE    RUN:cpu          1            
  9        DONE    RUN:cpu          1            

Stats: Total Time 9
Stats: CPU Busy 5 (55.56%)
Stats: IO Busy  4 (44.44%)

If we do SWITCH_ON_END, then the CPU utilization is altered and goes pretty bad. It becomes same as scheduling a CPU process first and then a process which does I/O.



Q 5)Now, run the same processes, but with the switching behavior set to switch to another process whenever one is WAITING for I/O (-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_IO). What happens now? Use -c and -p to confirm that you are right.
A 5)The trace for the program is as follows - 
Time     PID: 0     PID: 1     PID: 2     PID: 3        CPU        IOs

If we set -S SWITCH_ON_IO we see that the PID 0 (one with the I/O) is only scheduled after all other CPU jobs are complete and hence the CPU utilized is only 66% of the time. We will see how we can improve this in the below questions.



Q 6)One other important behavior is what to do when an I/O completes. With -I IO_RUN_LATER, when an I/O completes, the process that issued it does not necessarily run right away; rather, whatever was running at the time keeps running. What happens when you run this combination of processes? (Run ./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -I IO_RUN_LATER -c -p) Are system resources being effectively utilized?
A 6) Running -I IO_RUN_LATER brings no change to scheduling. We see the same result as above (Q 5) -

Q 7)Now run the same processes, but with -I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE set, which immediately runs the process that issued the I/O. How does this behavior differ? Why might running a process that just completed an I/O again be a good idea?

Setting the -I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE, helps us to use the CPU more efficiently. Whenever an I/O job comes to a ready state, we schedule it which makes other processes to use the CPU meanwhile. Two kills with one stone.
